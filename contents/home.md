In the Benton Lab, our mission is to unravel the complexities of biological data by applying innovative computational methodologies. With a dedicated focus on deciphering how DNA sequences influence gene regulation, we strive to uncover insights that can revolutionize our understanding of human health and disease. We are particularly interested in the application of computer science techniques to interpret the impact of genetic variation on gene regulatory processes, and to understand the genetic and environmental risk factors of substance use.

The Benton Lab is at the forefront of developing new approaches that push the boundaries of bioinformatics research. We actively engage in interdisciplinary collaboration and the exploration of novel computational techniques across many subfields.

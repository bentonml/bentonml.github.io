Welcome to the Benton Lab. We use cutting-edge computational methods to explore the impact of genetic variation on gene regulation, understand risk factors and physiological effects of alcohol use, and develop open-source tools for reproducible science. We actively engage in interdisciplinary collaboration and the exploration of novel computational techniques across many subfields.
